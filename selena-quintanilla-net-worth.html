I’m forever grateful and I’m grateful for the platform Netflix is able to give us, to be able to talk about this series. I don’t think that a lot of people realize that this type of platform is not given to everyone, especially us as Mexican-Americans.”</p><h2>What is Selena Quintanilla’s net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Selena was worth $10 million at the time o her death in 1995.
