The sermon, which has gone viral on social media, includes a video of the pastor “rebuking” people who come to see the singer perform.</p><p>Tiphani Montgomery posted a video on TikTok that has received over 20,000 views. In the caption, she wrote:</p><p><strong>“Baalyonce doesn’t even try to hide her devotion to her various gods. The devil granted her INFLUENCE over MILLIONS, which she successfully uses for the kingdom of darkness.”</strong></p><p>Tiphani Montgomery was a Beyoncé fan. She can be heard saying in the TikTok video: “Netizens call her a hypocrite.”</p><p><strong>“In the name of Jesus, I admonish anyone attending Beyoncé’s performance. You have no right to identify as a Christian. I don’t care who your pastor is, who your pastor approves of it, and who your pastor sings along to the tunes because they want some clout.”</strong></p><p>Tiphani not only called Beyoncé a “witch,” but she also attacked the singer’s fans, saying:</p><p><strong>“A coven is not uncommon among witches. Covens of witches are typically comprised of three to seven members. When the number of bees reaches thousands, it is referred to as a hive. Are you a part of that woman’s Beyhive? And you consider yourself a Christian? May the Lord’s favor be with you.”</strong></p><p>After the video went viral, others began looking into Tiphani Montgomery’s social media profile and discovered tweets from 2010, 2011, and 2014 in which she stated that she liked Beyoncé’s music and claimed to have attended several of her concerts.</p><p>Several social media users called her a “hypocrite” for now criticizing Beyoncé fans. Montgomery, on the other hand, addressed her earlier remarks, claiming that until August 2015, she was the biggest Beyoncé and Jay-Z fan. Nonetheless, the video and Tiphani Montgomery’s remark about Beyoncé did not go down well with netizens, with many criticizing her in tweets.</p><p>Many people referred to her as a “hypocritical sinner,” pointing out that she had written erotica. Despite widespread condemnation of Montgomery, a few fans appear to agree with the pastor’s statements and have expressed support on social media. The films of Montogomery have received a lot of attention on social media, with many people reposting them multiple times.</p><h2>What you need to know about Tiphani Montgomery amid the Beyoncé saga</h2><p>Many people were curious about Tiphani Montgomery after she stepped onstage and shouted out Beyoncé.
