EVERYTHING... that's why I gained so much weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000545992647-e1575821485424.jpg><p>“I was having too much fun, I was celebrating too much.</p><p>“Even out of shape, even the way that I was training back and forth (between Mexico and California) ... f******, I did pretty good, dude!

I want those belts back!”</p><p>In hindsight, the partying and lack of professionalism is all the more evident, with Ruiz Jr’s 30th birthday party a damning indication of the former world champion’s downfall.</p><p>Featuring naked sushi girls, waitresses in lingerie and a host of A-list celebrities, the first heavyweight champion of the world of Mexican origin clearly allowed his newfound fame and fortune to get to his head.</p><p>Of course, there is no shame in this. The aim of prize fighting is of course to get in, get out and make as much money as possible. And in June, the proud family man told E News just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how he spent his seven-figure pay day earned from his first fight.</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🎂 Inside Andy Ruiz Jr's extravagant 30th birthday party this weekend, featuring:</p><p>💻 Logan And Jake Paul<br>🍣 Naked Sushi Lady<br>💃 Waitresses In Lingerie <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CSMoxxyWX3</a></p>— Michael Benson (@MichaelBensonn) <a href=#>August 26, 2019</a><p>“First of all I bought a car for my mum,” he said. “That was the first purchase that I made with the money that I got.</p><p>“I bought my mum a car because I messed up a lot of her cars when I was young.
