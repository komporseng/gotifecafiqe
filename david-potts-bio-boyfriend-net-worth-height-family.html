He was previously dating Luke AKA Luke Vain from Cardiff, someone he met on Celebs Go Dating. However, their relationship ended because “maintaining a relationship with David was always going to be difficult due to the cameras,” according to RealityTitBits.</p><p>Luke told the outlet, “It was very difficult to maintain a relationship when the only time you see each other is in front of the camera. We couldn’t grow organically, because we were never allowed to speak to each other outside of the show.”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is David Potts?</strong></h3><p>According to Famous Birthdays, David Potts’s date of birth is 5 May 1993.

Since Ibiza Weekender last aired, David has been on a bit of a fitness journey. In a side-by-side transformation post on Instagram, David wrote: “Three STONE DOWN HUNS!! Ahhhhh I can’t believe it! I changed my lifestyle four months ago now and I’ve never been so motivated. This new skinny me is only another seven stone away and I cannot wait! I wanna say a massive thank you so @davidnorrispt for pushing me and keeping me motivated!”</p><p>He concluded the post with, “Also wanna say thank you to one of my best friends @hayleyfanshaw for always being there for support!

It’s just basically a calorie-deficit diet and then I’m also doing my personal training sessions as well with my PT who’s amazing and puts me through my paces.

David’s role is to plan the complete island-hopping experience, despite the impression that the reps only do shots and drink cocktails. El Jefe works as a rep in Ibiza, Magaluf, and other tourist hotspots when he isn’t performing on ITV2.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is David Potts Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>David Pott’s birthday is on 5 May.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is David Potts From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>David Potts was born in Manchester,&nbsp;England.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is David Potts On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, David Potts is on Instagram (<a href=#>@davidpottsx</a>).</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmnZmmnrFuvM6tq6xlkp68bq7Osp2roZWjsW66xK1ksKeiqbVutMSinqGsXZuurrXLsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-harman.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Harman Net Worth, Weight, Bio, Age, Height</span></a>
