According to her birth date, she is 30 years old. Additionally, Hunter is an American national with Caucasian ancestry. Hunter is a devout Christian who was born under the sign of Taurus.

When she was 15 years old, four agencies advised her that she needed to lose three inches around her hips in order to be considered for work as a size zero model. Following that, she began her career as a straight-size model at the age of 16. However, she did not receive enough modeling assignments because many agencies believed she was too large for a size 2.</p><p>As a result, she felt not only sad, upset, and embarrassed, but also attempted to starve herself to conform to a model’s conventional image. For three years, I battled insecurities. One day, her life changed dramatically after seeing a ‘Vogue Italia’ cover featuring plus-size models Robyn Lawley, Tara Lynn, and Candice Huffine.</p><p>Additionally, she visited Wilhelmina Models, where she was selected and signed for three modeling jobs within a week, including Forever 21, Lucky Brand Jeans, and Miami Swim Week.

Every model’s career culminated with an appearance in ‘Sports Illustrated.’ Hunter’s dream came true in December 2016 when she auditioned for the ‘SI Swimsuit 2017 Model Search’ and was chosen to appear in the magazine on a spread.</p><p>She was featured in the ‘Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue’ in 2017. For the photoshoot, she appeared on the beach wearing only body paint. As a result of her popularity, she was hired as a rookie the following year. Hunter was the first plus-size model to appear on the cover of ‘The Knot.’ Additionally, she is affiliated with an agency known as ‘Wilhelmina Models.’</p><h2>Hunter McGrady’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p>She has earned a respectable sum as a plus-size model, actress, and body-positive activist. <strong>In terms of her net worth, it is estimated to be around $6.5 million US dollars as of October 2023.</strong> Additionally, there are details about her salary and earnings.</p><h2>Hunter McGrady Husband, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Hunter McGrady</strong> married Brian Keys in Moorpark, California, on 16 June 2019.
