Background and Controversy In 2016, Ariel Helwani was banned from covering UFC events in person, a decision attributed to his reporting going &#34;beyond the purpose of standard journalism&#34; according to the UFC's official statement following the ban's rescission.
The ban stemmed from an incident at UFC 199, where Helwani, along with fellow MMAFighting reporters Esther Lin and Casey Leydon, was thrown out of the event and given a lifelong ban by UFC President Dana White."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
