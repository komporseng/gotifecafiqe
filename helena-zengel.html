Surprisingly, Helena never pursued any acting classes and claims that she naturally possessed the skills. In an interview, while talking about her ability to act, she said,</p><p>Acting is actually normal for me…I never had acting classes or anything, so it’s just something natural I like to do.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span>Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Hair Color: </strong>Honey Blonde</p><p><strong>Eye Color: </strong>Blue</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Helena-Zengel-1.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Ethnicity></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Ethnicity></span>Family & Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Helena’s parents are musicians.
