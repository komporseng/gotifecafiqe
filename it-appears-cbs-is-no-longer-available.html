does your direct tv have any canadian stations like global? global carried y & r plus you would get it a day ahead.
Yea you can stream the CBS app by using Ruko or firestick. Believe it’s like $10 a month."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Believe it’s like $10 a month. I hate these cable/satellite companies. I cut cable from Spectrum about 9 months ago. Although the darm Wi-Fi is over $70 a month so I just stream everything now. Saving about $40 a month</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I just chromecast it from my computer or watch it on my laptop. You can watch the last 5 episodes for free w/out subscribing.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Hopefully drewxjacobs can find some relief in any of these suggestions.

You can also buy an HD antenna for 30.00 and get all of your local stations and then some, for free</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p><a class=mention href=#>@drewxjacobs</a> go to (LINK REMOVED BY ADMIN)</p><p>It’s the day ahead Canadian, that’s where I watch and it also has any eppys you’ve missed.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Thank you! I kind of get the impression it all may be temporary. CBS apparently is asking for an unreasonably high “fee” from AT&T (which owns Direct TV) & although they have offered them much more than they pay other broadcast networks, CBS has chosen the blackout method, even including local CBS affiliates. CBS has systematically done this for the past several months - strong arming one provider after the other into paying their “ransom” or forcing viewers onto their subscription service, at least that is the way I understand it.</p><p>At any rate, I’ll give all these ideas a go & if successful, show my “technophobe” mom how to watch her “stories” as well.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I used to have Dish and the same thing happened about once a year. It’s ridiculous. It’s not just CBS either, I remember TCM doing the same thing and was off the air for months, and numerous other stations…All they are doing is shooting themselves in the foot because more and more people are going to streaming tv…I bought a Roku 4K and haven’t looked back and could not be happier. $10 a month for Netflix and $119 a year for Amazon Prime plus tons of free apps on the Roku. There is always something to watch. The only thing I watch on CBS is Y&R and you can always catch that on line.</p><p>Also, Dish and Direct TV raise their package prices by at least $5 every year. That adds up fast in a couple of years on top of their already high prices. I don’t see Dish or Direct even being in business within the next 5 years.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I agree. It’s not all CBS or AT&T or whomever it happens to be next. It’s all about money. It’s not about the viewer, that’s for sure. Personally, other than soaps, I don’t have much use for the major network stations. Netflix has a wide variety of shows to watch … I have an Amazon Prime account & it’s time to take full advantage of it. With those, I don’t have to put up with the endless talk shows, reality shows, game shows … I may be thanking CBS before it’s all over. <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png title=:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: alt=:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Neither are currently worth watching.

Wish me luck that this works where Firestick does not. If not, I was able to pull it up on the site suggested by PerfectStorm - a big thank you! I showed my mother how to do it & she’s now a happy camper, too! She’s loving the day ahead bonus at least for Y&R.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>We went totally old-school and bought a pair of rabbit-ears! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> I don’t care a whole lot about this show so I watch on youtube.
