The fundamental idea of the TV show is for the Fab Five to transform a heterosexual man into a total makeover man. Tan, on the other hand, is in charge of the group’s fashion. France made his decision and embarked on a stylish journey. The most important rule was to approach it as a job rather than a role. He’s made a name for himself not only on-screen but also off-screen. He is linked to British businesses such as ‘State’ and ‘Kingdom.’</p><h2>Height, weight, and size of the body</h2><p>Tan stands 5 feet 8 inches tall and is a gorgeous hunk with a terrific physique.
