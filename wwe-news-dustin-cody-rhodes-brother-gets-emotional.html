Their iconic match at AEW: Double or Nothing 2019 was brutal, emotional and praiseworthy. Both Cody and Dustin have been with the company since the very beginning. While Cody Rhodes had joined in as an EVP along with Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks at the time of inception of the company, Dustin Rhodes had joined the promotion in 2019.</p><p>In a shocking turn of events, Cody left AEW and joined WWE to return at WrestleMania 38 as Seth Rollins’ mystery opponent. This has left a huge void in AEW, but Dustin Rhodes is still associated with the company. Formerly known as Goldust in WWE, Dustin recently reflected on Cody Rhodes’ brand switch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Speaking on the latest edition of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Talk is Jericho</a>, Dustin Rhodes said,&nbsp;“Kind of down, a little bit. But Cody, he’s still young. There’s such an age gap, 16 years. He’s kind of in his prime now. But watching him return on WrestleMania was just huge. I’m not gonna miss any of his stuff. He’s on the rise to become a champion, and I really think he’s set the tone for that in his last eight years of work and things that he’s done,”&nbsp;(H/T- Fightful)</p><p>While talking about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cody Rhodes</a>&nbsp;from a creative standpoint, Dustin said that both of them are very different persons. He described Cody as very professional in nature and described him being creative just like their late father, The Legendary Dusty Rhodes. He further referred himself as a “grunt, worker in the family” while he praised Cody for surpassing his limits but in the end said-&nbsp;“I wish he was still here.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=# data-type=web-story data-id=893625>Top 8 All Time moments of Roman Reigns in WWE</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Jericho Reveals That Cody Rhodes Still Misses AEW</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Adobe_Express_20221124_0112030_1-1024x576.jpg><p>While talking about his current relationship with Cody,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Jericho</a>&nbsp;said that he still gets several texts from The American Nightmare that he still misses AEW and the guys he worked with there. Jericho also said that even he misses Rhodes and got close to him while working with him in AEW, unlike in WWE. He also said that Cody was always the type of guy he would like.</p><p>While there had been a lot of speculation around the fact why Cody Rhodes had left AEW, a company that he had helped right from its inception, the former TNT Champion said that he left the company because of financial issues and a creative crisis, since he was being continuously booed by the fans even after being presented as a face in the company.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=# data-type=post data-id=893086>32-Year-Old WWE Superstar, Endorsed by The Rock, Provides an Update on His Health</a></p><p>Cody Rhodes is currently recovering from a torn pectoral muscle, which he suffered while working out for a fight with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seth Rollins</a>&nbsp;at Hell in a Cell.
