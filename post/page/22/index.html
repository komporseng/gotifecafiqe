May I add a voice to this year-old chorus?I loved the whole Orange Islands arc as a kid. The map in Official Handbook 2 was top-tier world-building for me, before I even knew what that was; I thought I was so clever when I found the elemental islands from M2.
Now that I'm grown, I'm less wowed than I used to be, but I still see some value in it. I understand that the whole thing in the anime was filler until G2 got finalized, and that the later generations introduced tons of ways to build your relationship with/between your mons, and hone/practice their skills unrelated to combat.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bad News!
