Participants in a clinical trial for Vuity say buyers can expect big things.</p><p>“It’s definitely a life changer,” trial participant Toni Wright <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told CBS News</a> of her experience with the drops, which take effect in just 15 minutes and enhance vision for six to 10 hours, according to the company. Now, it’s the first-ever treatment for age-related blurred vision to gain FDA approval. It works by helping the eye naturally reduce pupil size, CBS reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Vuity, 54-year-old Wright relied heavily on her reading glasses, which she would stash around her house and “would always need to have [on]” when working on a computer. Since beginning the trial, she simply pops one drop in each eye for significantly improved sight — and a break from her cumbersome spectacles.</p><p>“I was in denial because to me that was a sign of growing older, you know, needing to wear glasses,” the Pennsylvania-based retail consultant told CBS. She added that it’s particularly convenient for her “to have that option of putting the drops in and being able to go.”</p><p>In addition to offering an easy alternative to reading glasses for millions of those who develop farsightedness (the medical term for which is presbyopia) as they age, the drops are also relatively affordable: A 30-day supply costs approximately $80 without insurance.</p><p>It’s unlikely that the treatment will be covered under most healthcare plans as it’s not considered “medically necessary” given the less expensive option of glasses, doctors told CBS.</p><p>Minor side effects were noted during the three-month trial, including headaches and red eyes, according to Vuity’s statement to CBS. It may also be less effective for those aged 65 and up. Because the drops are so new, thus making it impossible to study the impacts of long-term use just yet, the maker warns against driving in darkened conditions while the treatment is in effect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGtmamhfm7GiecCpp6unpprAbrHYnmSdqp%2BlwG7Ax5qrZpufqrmledGep6WZk5p6s7HAnaCnn12cuaK%2F0p6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elephants-trample-poacher.html><span>←</span><span>Elephant Herd Tramples One Poacher To Death, Injures Another</span></a>
