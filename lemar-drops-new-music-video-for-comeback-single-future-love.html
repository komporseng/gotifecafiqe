I thought I’d like to make something for the people who got behind that album, something that they would appreciate and like. That’s really reflected in the first single&nbsp;‘Future Love’. It’s more uptempo, it’s got that soulful feel, it’s a bit looser, a bit&nbsp;<strong>Chaka Khan</strong>. A bit&nbsp;‘Dance (With U)’… it’s got that kind of energy to it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-1021x1024.jpeg><p>Along with the launch of his new material, <strong>Lemar</strong> is to celebrate two decades of music, and the 20th anniversary release of his debut album “Dedicated” next month, performing two special live shows in Manchester (April 27th) and London (April 28th). Tickets for both gigs are on-sale now at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gigsandtours.co.uk</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ticketmaster.co.uk</a>.</p><p>Released back in the winter of 2003, ‘Dedicated’ won rave reviews from both fans and critics alike, with <strong>The Guardian</strong> calling the singer “North London’s answer to <strong>Luther Vandross</strong>“, and BBC Music’s <strong>Karen Goodchild</strong> stating: “this is an album that is packed full of potential hits that showcase Lemar’s amazing vocal ability. That, coupled with the fact that Lemar co-wrote several of these tracks, will surely mean that he’ll be around a lot longer than the other over-hyped reality TV stars.”</p><p>Featuring the top ten hit singles, “Dance (With U)”, “50/50” and “Another Day”, the album is certified double-platinum by the <strong>BPI</strong> for sales in excess of 300,000 copies.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>“Page In My Heart” is available to pre-order&nbsp;<a href=#>now</a>.</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Let us know your thoughts on Lemar over on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a> now!</strong></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuaa5wKtknaqfpcBuusSwZKato56wbsLInZyoZZakv26vzqacm5mToHq0tc2go55llqrBtr7EZqOorpVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kolton-pierce.html><span>←</span><span>Kolton Pierce - Bio, Age, Single, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
