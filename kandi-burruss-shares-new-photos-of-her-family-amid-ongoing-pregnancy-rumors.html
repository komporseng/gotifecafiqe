Ace was willing to take a candid with his mom in the first shot. <a href=#>Blaze</a> gave the camera her attention in the second picture Kandi uploaded.</p><p>“Blaze wasn’t interested,” one fan said in reference to Kandi’s comment about one of the Tucker kids “doing their own thing.” Another of the RHOA star’s Instagram followers wrote, “Love them! My girl Blazy Blaze!”</p><p>The <a href=#>pregnancy rumors</a> continue to revolve around Kandi Burruss and her family despite the celebrity mom and her husband, Todd Tucker, dispelling such speculation last year. Several fans recognized a candid Todd shared that showed Kandi showing off what appeared to be a baby bump as Burruss in-character on the set of one of her acting projects. Some, however, took the notion of Kandi expecting another child and broadcast the news without doing research first.</p><p>Burruss explained that she was unable to conceive by natural means after giving birth to her son, Ace, a few months ago. Such is the reason why the RHOA star and her husband went the way of a surrogate to expand their family with Blaze.</p><p>Kandi Burruss gave advice to other women considering surrogacy during a recent interview with <a href=#>ESSENCE</a>. “You need to start having those conversations now, because it’s not a fast process,” the celebrity mom shared. “The overall thought process is: it’s your baby but their body,” Kandi added. “Meaning, if [the birth mother] is not feeling well or things are [effecting her health] she can say, ‘terminate the pregnancy.’ Although it didn’t stop me from wanting to move forward, there are a lot of things you don’t know.”</p><p>Blaze and Ace are <a href=#>Kandi Burruss and Todd Tucker’s children</a> together. The celebrity couple parents four kids – Blaze, Ace, Riley, and Kaela – in all. Catch Kandi and her family every week on the Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><p>Photo: Kandi Burruss/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmaWtfZoNwt8Cnm6Jlkqq%2Fs8HSrGSsoJGnsrR5zZ6uZqiYpMGwv4yonWaglad6p63MoqOyZZGitqV5zqeeqKGenHqxvsSgpZqmk656s8HMqKmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-santos-husband-matt-relationship-dating.html><span>←</span><span>George Santos Husband 2023 Matt: Gay Relationship And Dating History</span></a>
