Nowadays Linda is known as an American actress, businessperson and author who has been able to accumulate estimate net worth which is valued as big as 20 million dollars. But of course, the main amount of net worth estimated by Linda Bollea has been received while playing in the popular American reality TV show entitled “Hogan Knows Best”. That’s why today Linda is one of the richest women in United States, and furthermore, she has gained more popularity as being the wife of <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>, a professional wrestler. Linda Hogan was born on August 24, 1959, in Miami, Florida, United States of America.</p><h3>Linda Hogan Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>She had Swedish, English and German ancestries. At a young age Linda attended Chaminade College Preparatory School, which was located in Canoga Park, California. Later she participated in the famous panel game show called “Match Game”, which was directed by Marc Breslow. It was the first serious addition to net worth which was gained by Linda herself, however, then no one could know how rich Linda Hogan was going to be after several years, while appearing in one more famous show, “Hogan Knows best”. “Hogan Knows Best” was aired on American channel VH1 from 2005. The show was actually based on the personal life of <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> and his relationships with his family, and that’s why his wife Linda was able to gain estimated net worth which is can be called amazingly large if we compare it to other stars in show business.</p><p>The first time Linda met her future husband <a href=#>Hogan</a> was in Los Angeles while dining in a restaurant. The couple started to date and for more than two years they were involved in a long-distance kind of relationship before their wedding in 1983. Of course, this was the year when Linda’s net worth increased immediately thanks to the popularity of her famous husband. The couple have two kids together. <a href=#>Brooke Hogan</a> is the older sister, born in year 1998, and the younger <a href=#>Nick Hogan</a>, born two years later. He is also known as a reality TV personality and actor. However, the couple were not together for too long. They divorced in year 2007, but despite that the net worth estimated by Linda Hogan still remained as big as it was before. So now you can better imagine the estimated amount of Linda’s net worth thanks to her great acting career and also thanks to her well known ex-husband. It is known that nowadays Linda is single and does not date anyone. It is also need to be mentioned that Linda is an active supporter of animal rights and also of all the campaigns which work against the abuse of animals. That is the reason thy Linda’s net worth also helped PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal). Nowadays Linda is known as a rich businesswoman who has launched her own clothing line and that’s why Hogan’s net worth has risen again.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=13.008298755187><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Linda Hogan</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 24, 1959</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Miami, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.74 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Author, Spokesperson</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of Colorado Boulder, University of Colorado</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Hulk Hogan (m. 1983–2009)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Brooke Hogan, Nick Hogan</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Christie Claridge</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Linda Marie Claridge , Linda Hogan , Linda Bollea Hogan , Linda Claridge</td></tr><tr readability=0.19178082191781><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/lindahoganhttp://www.twitter.com/lindahogan</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm1972601</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>American Book Awards, Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts, US & Canada, Lannan Literary Award for Poetry</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Pulitzer Prize for Fiction</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Hogan Knows Best</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=4.7165697674419><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>She is a graduate of Chatsworth High School (Chatsworth, CA).
