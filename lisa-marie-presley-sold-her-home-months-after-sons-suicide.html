Emergency personnel arrived, and he was pronounced dead on the scene.</p><p>According to the autopsy report, he had attempted suicide six months earlier by “overdosing on alcohol and cocaine.”</p><p>Lisa’s manager, Roger Widynowski, told The Post that following her son’s unexpected death, “she is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11 year old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”</p><p>In her final Instagram post — a now-chilling upload from this past August — Lisa Marie wrote about her “grief” over her son, whom she shared with musician Danny Keough.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“In honor of it being National Grief Awareness Day, I wrote an essay about Grief which was posted today on @people,” her post said. “I thought I’d post it here in the hopes that anyone who needs to hear all of this it helps in some way.”</p><p>I’m sharing my thoughts in the hopes that somehow, we can change that,” she said in the essay, adding: “Grief does not stop or go away in any sense. Grief is something you will have to carry with you for the rest of your life, in spite of what certain people or our culture wants us to believe. You do not ‘get over it,’ you do not ‘move on,’ period.”</p><p>If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts or are experiencing a mental health crisis and live in New York City, you can call 1-888-NYC-WELL for free and confidential crisis counseling.
