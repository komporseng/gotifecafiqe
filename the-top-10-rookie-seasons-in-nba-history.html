Without further ado, let's get on to the Top 10 rookie seasons in NBA history, from their memorable displays to amazing feats and the historical aspect of these first-year players.</span></p><h3><b>1. Wilt Chamberlain - Philadelphia Warriors, 1959-60</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">37.6 PPG, 27 RPG, and 2.3 APG. Received MVP and RoTY</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Chamberlain had the best rookie season by an NBA player ever, completely dominating the league en route to records in scoring and rebounding that haven't been matched. He was dominant from the jump and was immediately put in the conversation for one of the most influential players to ever play in the NBA.</span></p><h3><b>2. Cincinnati Royals, Oscar Robertson, 1960-61</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">30.5 PPG, 10.1 RPG, 7 APG</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">His near triple-double average in his rookie season showed just how talented he was and what effect those would have on the Royals squad during his first year with them. It only underscored how special and, in hindsight, what a rarity that rookie year had been.</span></p><h3><b>3. Chicago Packers, Walt Bellamy, 1961-62</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;31.6 PPG,19 RPG</span></p><p>Walt Bellamy had an impressive rookie season in the NBA in 1961-1962. Playing for the Chicago Packers (later known as the Washington Wizards), Bellamy averaged 31.6 points per game and 19 rebounds per game. His outstanding performance earned him the NBA Rookie of the Year award that season, setting a strong foundation for his successful career in professional basketball.</p><h3><b>4. Milwaukee Bucks, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 1969-70</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">26.2 PPG, 14.3 PPG</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Abdul-Jabbar's arrival turned the Bucks into an instant title contender, luring a player to Milwaukee and setting in motion his own Hall of Fame career that would go on to change how NBA big men play.</span></p><h3><b>5. Minneapolis Lakers, Elgin Baylor, 1958-59</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">24.9 PPG, 15 RPG, 4.1 APG</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Baylor was one of the best scorers and rebounders from his first year in the league, efficiently influencing play for a Laker team that would feature another future all-time great.</span></p><h3><b>6. Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan, 1984-85</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">28.2 PPG, 6.5 RPG, and 5.9 APG</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan entered the league with perhaps its most electric debut season before laying down a blueprint that others have attempted to follow for nearly four decades. The scoring that he was able to bring and the impact that his mere presence had on the Chicago Bulls, laid the foundation for things bigger in the future.</span></p><h3><b>7. Los Angeles Lakers, Magic Johnson, 1979-80</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">18.0 PPG, 7.3 APG, 7.8 REB</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Johnson made an immediate impact during his rookie season in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1979-1980. He averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game. Johnson's versatility and leadership helped lead the Lakers to the NBA Finals, where he famously started at center in Game 6 due to an injury to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and delivered 42 points, 15 rebounds, and 7 assists, securing the championship and earning NBA Finals MVP honors.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>8. Boston Celtics, Larry Bird, 1979-80</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">21.3&nbsp;PPG, 10.4RPG, 5 APG&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Bird's effect on how the Celtics played and his quick feud with Magic Johnson launched an exceptional date range in NBA history. This only further showcases his immense talent that virtually no one across our league has come close to having such a profound impact on their debut season.</span></p><h3><b>9.&nbsp; San Diego Rockets, Elvin Hayes, 1968-69</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;28.4 PPG, 17.1 RPG, 1.4 APG.</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes emerged as a scoring and rebounding machine right off the bat, leading Houston to heights no one expected in his first season en route to proving he was here for much longer than just this inaugural season.</span></p><h3><b>10. Baltimore Bullets, Wes Unsled, 1968-69</b></h3><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">13.8&nbsp;PPG,18.2&nbsp;RPG,&nbsp;2.6 APG, Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player.</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Unseld's contributions to the Bullets' success, combined with his stats, help illustrate how great his rookie year was and what it meant for NBA history.</span></p><p><span data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">These ten rookie seasons in NBA history have helped put an indelible mark on the league, contributing to the vast tapestry of basketball greatness. These are unquestionably some of the all-time great rookie campaigns that forever etched themselves into NBA history.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfqbWmedOop2ZpYGK%2FsLvKopxmq5WWwLC60magp2Wel65utMisq6iqqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lea-michele-sons-of-anarchy-season-7-episode-six.html><span>←</span><span>Lea Michele On Sons Of Anarchy Wows Execs On Season 7 Episode 6 Hollywood Life</span></a>
